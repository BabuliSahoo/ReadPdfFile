You see, the secret to superhuman willpower is willpower itself: self-
discipline begets self-discipline. Every time you act with discipline, you 
grow that muscle and become a little bit more disciplined. 
Every time you resist the cookie, you grow your willpower. Every time you 
opt for a book instead of the TV, you grow your willpower. Every time you 
resist the urge to check Facebook, you grow your willpower. Every time you 
get up early and resist hitting the snooze button, you grow your willpower. 
Every time you prioritize sleep over watching another episode of your 
favorite TV show, you grow your willpower. 
And remember, growing your willpower muscle directly translates into 
procrastinating less. 
Before we wrap up this chapter, there are two things I would like you to 
keep in mind on your journey to having more self-control. 
First of all, start small. Don’t try to go from zero to hero. Don’t aim to get up 
early, go for a morning run, take a cold shower, and then meditate for 20 
minutes. Unless you’re already very disciplined, this is a recipe for failure, 
discouragement, and self-criticism. 
Instead, start small. Slowly cut back on negative habits. Slowly build your 
life around positive, willpower-supporting habits. If you do that, you’ll find 
your self-control steadily becoming stronger and stronger. 
Second, expect lots of setbacks and drama on your journey. 
You’ll inevitably experience periods of despair, disappointment, and 
discouragement. You’ll feel like nothing’s working and you’re moving 
backwards instead of forwards. You’ll start doubting yourself. You’ll fall 
back into old habits. And so on and so forth. 
That’s to be expected. The best thing you can do during those times is to 
work on your self-compassion. 
Above all, stay patient. Building self-control takes time. Just keep at it and 
you’ll be sure to reap the rewards.

Chapter Summary 
The idea: Procrastination can be described as a self-control failure. If you 
want to do one thing, but end up doing something else, you simply lacked 
the necessary willpower to resist the allure of immediate gratification. In 
other words, you failed to control the self — you failed to control your own 
behavior. The good news is that willpower is subject to change. Even 
better, every improvement in willpower translates directly into an 
improvement with procrastination. 
The tactics 
Optimize your health and energy levels: Willpower is surprisingly 
physical and uses up the same energy we use for breathing, exercising, 
talking, moving around, etc. If your health sucks, you’ll lack the energy 
required for willpower and you’ll fail to overcome procrastination. The more 
energy you have, the more willpower you have, and the better you are at 
resisting the monkey’s constant pulls toward immediate gratification. I 
suggest optimizing your nutrition, exercise, sleep, and other health habits. 
Simplify your life: Every decision you make burns up a little bit of 
willpower — willpower that could be used to battle procrastination. By 
simplifying your life, you reduce the amount of decisions you have to make 
every day. Start by minimizing your wardrobe, planning your days the night 
before, and cycling through the same healthy meals over and over again. 
Meditate: Meditation has been shown to be one of the best strategies to 
improve willpower and grow the correlating brain structures. I suggest 
starting a daily mindfulness meditation habit with the use of the Headspace 
app. 
Exercise: Regular exercise is another powerful self-control booster. You 
don’t even need to go to the gym — anything from gardening to playing 
with kids or pets counts! As a general guideline, you want to exercise 
109 
intensively a couple of times per week and move at a low pace throughout 
the day as much as possible. 
Grow your self-compassion: Self-compassion is one of my best kept 
secrets. It helps me cope with procrastination, makes me happier, relieves 
a lot of guilt, and has even been shown to boost willpower. From now on, 
resolve to treat yourself with understanding, care, and respect. Leave the 
constant criticism and harsh judgments behind. They only make things 
worse.

FINAL THOUGHTS 
Well, there you have it. 
Congrats on making it all the way to the end of this book. For a (soon to be 
ex-) procrastinator, that’s a monumental task. 
Hopefully, you’ve had a good time and learned a thing or two about 
procrastination. My hope is you’ll be able to take action from the tips, 
strategies, and insights we’ve discussed. 
Because that’s the key right there — taking action. 
You can read all the books in the world and learn fantastic ideas and 
tactics, but they won’t create any meaningful change unless you apply 
them to your own life. 
Unless you get your feet wet, nothing’s going to change. Taking the leap 
from theory to practice, from knowing to doing, is what separates 
stagnation from growth and winners from dreamers. 
One of my all-time favorite quotes illustrates this point beautifully. It’s from 
The Kybalion: 
"The possession of Knowledge, unless accompanied by a manifestation 
and expression in Action, is like the hoarding of precious metals — a vain 
and foolish thing. Knowledge, like wealth, is intended for Use. The Law of 
Use is Universal, and he who violates it suffers by reason of his conflict 
with natural forces." 
Knowledge is intended for use — not applying it is a vain and foolish thing 
to do. 
I feel this message is more appropriate at the end of a book on 
procrastination than anywhere else.

The typical reader, upon finishing the book, will say to themselves 
something along the lines of, “Wow, that was helpful information. I’ll 
definitely apply it once I have the time.” 
Don’t fall into that trap. 
Start executing some of the tactics immediately upon closing this book. 
Set some implementation intentions. Install a website-blocking browser 
extension. Declutter your desktop. Clean your room. Download the 
Headspace app. 
Once you’ve implemented one strategy, you’re 10x more likely to 
implement another, and another, and another. But you need to start 
somewhere, and you need to stop worrying about getting it perfect. 
There’s no perfect anti-procrastination regimen. Don’t let your monkey tell 
you there is. It is just trying to make excuses for not taking action right now. 
The last thing the monkey wants to do right now is implement these tactics. 
Instead, it wants to watch some TV or hop on Facebook. “You deserve it,” it 
will say. 
 
112 
Stop taking orders from a pleasure addict. 
(caption on same page as image) Heck, you’re probably already feeling a 
little anxious, tense, or insecure right now. You probably feel the urge to 
run away from taking action. 
Don’t do it. 
Stay put. Relax. Then execute. 
Oh, and one last piece of advice before we wrap this up: Be prepared for a 
bumpy ride. Overcoming procrastination isn’t exactly a walk in the park. It’s 
more like a never-ending pain in the ass. 
It’s hard work. It’s messy. It’s discouraging at times. 
You’ll experience many defeats on your road to redemption. You’ll feel like 
you’re not making enough progress. You’ll feel like you’re moving 
backwards. You’ll feel like giving up and choosing comfort over growth. 
That’s normal. 
Your job is to persevere. Forgive yourself for fucking up and get back on 
track as swiftly as possible. 
The Buddha allegedly said, “Persevere in your quest and you will find what 
you seek. Pursue your aim unswervingly and you will gain victory. Struggle 
earnestly and you will triumph.” 
Just keep putting in the work and you will reap the rewards. 
Best of luck on your journey.

P.S. Speaking of Taking Action... 
If you haven’t already, now is the time to download the Stop Procrastinating 
Action Guide. 
Downloading the Action Guide and doing the exercises will do more for 
overcoming procrastination than merely reading the book. 
Why? Because you’re forced to do something with the ideas presented 
here. 
So far, this has been a passive process. The Action Guide forces you to 
become active – to reflect, think, plan, and prepare. This will make a 
massive difference in cementing these ideas firmly in your mind, which 
ensures you’ll know exactly what to do when the urge to procrastinate 
strikes in real life.  
Oh, and don’t hesitate to drop me a message at nils@njlifehacks.com if you 
have any thoughts, questions, or feedback. I love hearing from readers, 
and I’ll get back to you as soon as possible. 
To a productive and prosperous life!

So thanks for downloading my book and reading all the way to the end. 
Now I’d like to ask for a small favor. Could you take a moment to leave a
