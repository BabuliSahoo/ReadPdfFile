        One last thing I want to address is that I’ve repeated certain ideas throughout the book. 
        This isn’t to bore you; rather, it’s to help you learn these ideas by heart.
        As you’ve probably heard thousands of times in school, repetition is the mother of learning.
        The book is roughly divided into three parts.
