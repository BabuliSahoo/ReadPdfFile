      One last thing I want to address is that I’ve repeated certain ideas
      throughout the book. This isn’t to bore you; rather, it’s to help you
      learn these ideas by heart. As you’ve probably heard thousands of times in
      school, repetition is the mother of learning. The book is roughly divided
      into three parts.
